Due to some confusion around the fields and data shown in the provided screenshot, I had to improvise certain parts of the UI and data structure.
But the Core CRUD functionality is implemented as requested.|

used React JS to create this APP.
Also used Material UI as a UI component Library, React-Router-Dom for Routing.

All data storage and handling is done with the help of Localstorage and React state (useState)
